# ECEN_2350_Project1

If you want to make a change that you can test using Quartus download the zip. Once you've finished just copy and paste the code to the correct file in the master-edits branch as an edit to be merged. Then make a pull request for the changes to be reviewed and implemented into the master branch.
Does this need a pull request to change?
